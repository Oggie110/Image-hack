## üéØ Prioritization

### High Priority (Next 2-4 weeks)
1. Export functionality
2. Wireframe/sketching tools
3. Keyboard shortcuts
4. Undo/redo
5. Layer thumbnails

### Medium Priority (1-2 months)
1. Advanced AI features (image-to-image, inpainting)
2. Cloud save
3. More AI providers
4. Drawing tools
5. Text layers

### Low Priority (Future)
1. Collaboration features
2. Animation
3. Mobile apps
4. Plugin system

## üìù Notes

### Wireframe/Sketching Feature Details

The wireframe/sketching feature will enable users to:

1. **Sketch directly on canvas** - Use simple drawing tools to create rough wireframes
2. **Convert to AI images** - Use the sketch as a guide for AI generation
3. **Hybrid workflow** - Combine sketching with prompt-based generation
4. **Sketch layers** - Treat sketches as a special layer type
5. **ControlNet integration** - Use advanced AI models that understand sketches

**Implementation approach:**
- Add drawing tools (pen, line, shapes) to toolbar
- Create sketch layer type that stores vector paths
- Integrate with ControlNet-compatible AI models
- Allow sketch + text prompt combined generation
- Option to hide/show sketch layer after generation

**Use cases:**
- Quick wireframe mockups ‚Üí high-fidelity designs
- Rough composition sketches ‚Üí polished images
- Logo concepts ‚Üí final logos
- UI layouts ‚Üí realistic mockups
